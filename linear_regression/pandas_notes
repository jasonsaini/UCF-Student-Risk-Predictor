Series - one-dimensional labeled array, any data type
DataFrame - table with rows/cols, or two-dimensional array

dataframes (and assuming series as well) can be indexed by any 
hashable type (int, string, etc.)

looks like dataframes do not require a unique index for its types

NumPy arrays have one dtype for the entire array while pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column.

describe() shows a quick statistic summary of your data:

TODO optimized data access methods are
DataFrame.at(), DataFrame.iat(), DataFrame.loc() and DataFrame.iloc().
